            <p className="text-ink-dim">Hey —</p>

            <p>
              I wrote the first 53 books because the self-help section at the bookstore made me
              physically angry. Every one of them written by someone who had never run a payroll
              or shipped a customer order. Their idea of "operations" was a coaching frame.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thirteen years at <span className="metallic-text">Spiker Carpet and Tile Care</span> taught me
              that real discipline is not a vibe — it is a Tuesday morning. It is the second
              hour after a sleepless night. It is the email you don't want to send. The books
              are the field notes from those Tuesdays.
            </p>

            <p>
              If the genre got you nowhere, this might. If it didn't, you'll find out fast — every
              book ships with a 400-word sample at the door and a free chapter to your inbox if
              you want it. No drip, no upsell.
            </p>

            <p className="text-ink-dim">Read what hits. Skip what doesn't. You decide.</p>
