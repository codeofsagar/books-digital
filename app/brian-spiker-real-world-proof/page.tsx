  'The customer who haggles for 20 minutes about a $40 dispute is the same customer who’ll leave you a 1-star review for a stain the cat made three days after you left. This is a law of physics.',
  'The employee who’s always 10 minutes late is the same employee who quits the day before the biggest job of the quarter. Also a law of physics. The universe is just like that.',
  'Weather will steal a Saturday from you and there is nothing — nothing — you can do about it. The "5 AM grind" guys never mention weather. They live in studio apartments.',
  'The deal is not done when they say yes. The deal is done when the check clears. Until then it’s a feelings exchange.',
  'Working harder is not working smarter. Working smarter without working harder is also a lie that broke people tell each other. Both. You have to do both. I’m sorry.',
  'Your business is one bad month away from feeling like a complete disaster and one good month away from making you feel like a genius. Neither feeling is accurate. Both will visit. Repeatedly.',
  'Most "business advice" online is written by people whose only business is selling business advice. Closed loop. Very profitable for them. Very expensive for you.',
  'You will not "scale" by reading. You will scale by doing things you don’t want to do, repeatedly, for years, while everyone in your life thinks you’re slightly insane for caring this much about something they don’t understand.',
