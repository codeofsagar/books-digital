              Brian knows what $9,999 feels like to someone serious. He&apos;s been running a
              business since 2013. He&apos;s seen $9,999 expenses that changed the company and
              $9,999 expenses that were complete disasters.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the first one, not the second one — but Brian&apos;s not going to sit here
              and convince you of that. Either you&apos;re in or you&apos;re not.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you&apos;re considering it: email Brian directly before you buy. He&apos;ll get
              on the phone. He&apos;ll tell you whether it makes sense for your specific
              situation. He&apos;ll probably talk some of you out of it. That&apos;s fine.
              He&apos;d rather have 100 right people than 100 anyone.
